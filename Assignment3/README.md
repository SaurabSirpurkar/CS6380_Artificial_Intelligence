Each team has to implement an algorithm and integrate it with the animation platform as demonstrated in the class. <br>
This is the capstone (here, grand) project for the course. <br><br>
I implemented an improved version of Divide-and-Conquer Beam Stack Search. The improvements addressed anytime return of the algorithm, while maintaining the same time complexity as the original version [here](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICAPS/2005/ICAPS05-010.pdf). For this, we introduced the notion of "constant-step backpropagation".<br>
